Redux Feedback Loop

## Description
This is an app that collects user reviews. It could be used for feedback after lectures, presentations, or even on the job. There are 3 pages that the user will enter a rating of 1-5 and a final page for gathering comments. The pages with scores gather feedback on how the user is feeling, how well they are understanding the material, and how well they are being supported. Once a score is entered, the user can go to the next page. They may choose to enter a comment, they will be taken to a review page and then cab submit their comments.
